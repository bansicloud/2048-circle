# 2048-circle
For those of you who love the game 2048, please check out my new variation: **[2048 Circle](http://kiraprograms.com/2048-circle)**! 

There are a ton of variations on the game (in fact, the game itself is a variation of 1024), however none have experimented with a non-square board. When the board is a circle, the game becomes just a bit harder to predict, so there is no simple strategy. 

I made this game from scratch, not by forking the original game. If you are interested in making your own 2048 variation, check out the code!
